    "\n",
    "1. **Random Variables**: A random variable is a variable whose value is subject to chance or uncertainty. It can take on different values with associated probabilities. Random variables can be discrete (taking on a finite or countable number of values) or continuous (taking on an uncountable number of values).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Distributions**: A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking on different values. It assigns probabilities to the possible outcomes of a random variable. Examples of probability distributions include the Bernoulli distribution, Gaussian distribution, and Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Joint Probability**: Joint probability refers to the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously. It captures the relationship between multiple random variables and their combined probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditional Probability**: Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It allows us to update our beliefs about a random variable based on new information or evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Independence**: Independence is a property of random variables where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event. If two random variables are independent, their joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bayes' Theorem**: Bayes' theorem is a fundamental rule in probability theory that describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence. It relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to make probabilistic inferences.\n"
